Welcome back, aliens, my name is Durin Dredy and let's continue with this series on Python. In fact in the earlier videos we have talked about what is Python, we have installed two software and we have also worked with certain operations, we had fun in the last session. Now in this video where I talk about what is variable, but first of all why do we need one? Let's try something here. So what I will do is I will go back to my previous example, we were adding two and three, so we have done with that, right? We are saying two plus three. Now if you remember in max what we do is we of course we work with numbers, but then when the moment you start with algebra you have this concept of using x and y, so what we do is we say let x is equal to five, can we do that here? So we have x equal to two. So I'm storing this value to in a variable called as x and that's a new word now, what is variable? So basically variable is a container where you can put your values example, we are storing two here in a container and the name of that container is x. Of course you can give any name doesn't matter, you can say ABC, you can say a box, you can give any name, right? So we can say x equal to two and the moment I say enter, now this is the first time when you said enter and you have not got any output, right? So in the earlier the problems what we did is when we said any operation it was giving you some output, here we have not got any output, it's just an assignment operation. So in assignment what we do is we have a variable name equal to a value, so we are assigning two to x, okay that works. So can I do this now, can I say x plus three? Yes, right? Because in x we have a value which is two, oh it works, you can see we got five that works, can I store three as well? Let's try, so I will say y is equal to three, now we have two variables x and y, so we have two boxes and now I will say x plus y, oh it works, right? It works, so we can say x has two y has three and we are adding them, okay? So that's why we can use them, but then why they are called as variables. Now normally when you say variable this term simply means you can change the value, can we change here? Can I say x equal to nine, can I change the value from two to nine? Let's try and the moment I say enter, oh it works, there was no error, but now if I try to do this, if I say x plus y, x will have a value which is two or nine, that's a question because we are changing it, but there is no error, enter, oh you got twelve, that means the value of x now is nine, okay? So we can change the value and now we can justify that what is variables, right? So what is variable? It's a box where you can have a value. Now do we need to define the type of the variable? You don't need to, so the moment I assign a value you can, it automatically detects what about value you are assigning, so in this case it is integer. Now let me just do this thing, what if I say x and if I say enter, what it will do? So the moment you say x and enter, it will print the value of x in this case which is nine, right? What if I use a variable ABC? Now of course we have not defined this variable, right? And we are still trying to use it. Now when I say enter, you got an error, the error is it says name error, ABC, name ABC is not defined and that's why we have not defined ABC yet. So if you are using a variable which is not defined, so it will of course give you an error. Now I will do one more thing. I will say x plus 10, so of course it will give you 19. Now what if I want to add 19 with y? I mean something, there's something in this way, which is 19 plus y. But then if you think about this 19, this is the output of the previous operation, right? Now if you want to use the output of the previous operation, we can use underscore. So underscore represents the output of the previous operation. And if I say enter, you can say we got 22. So it is 19 plus 3 which is 22. So we want this works, right? So this is amazing, you know, there are so many things you can work with this. So we can use variables for numbers, right? So we can use it for float or integer. What about string? Can I use names with, can I use variables with string or the string variable? Let's try. So I will get a variable as name and I will use a name as YouTube. And if I say enter, oh it works. And if I print name, we got YouTube. So it is perfectly working. So we can use string as well. So example, I can say name plus YouTube rocks. So you can see we got YouTube rocks. So it is name which is YouTube plus rocks. Okay, this, you want this work, that's perfectly fine. In fact, let me just do an experiment. Can I say name and space rocks? Okay, this is not working. So we have to make sure that you put plus there because if you have plus, then only it will try to interpret that. But there's this one thing which is very fancy here, you know? So we talk about YouTube, it's a string, right? And it's a combination of characters. That means, if I want to fetch one character, it should be able, we should be able to do that, right? And yes, we can do that. So if I say name and if I want to fetch one character, how will I do that? So let's say if I have a YouTube here and YouTube has seven letters or seven characters, if you when you break it down, it will create an array or you can say collection of characters, the numbering starts with zero because normally in computers, numbering always starts with zero. So here, if you want to fetch it, we have to use a square bracket and you have to mention zero. So we are specifying, hey, I want to fetch the first letter of names. In this case, it is why? How it works? So now I will fetch the last one which is six, which is E in this case. I've got E, that works. Now I will fetch, let's say eight. See, we don't have eight, we don't have nine characters, right? We only have seven characters. So the first one is zero, the last one is six. How about eight? The moment you do that, it will give you an error. It says index error, string index out of range. So of course, you are going out of your limit, right? So you cannot do that. Okay, can I use negative numbers? Let's try. I will use minus one. So I want your guess here, what you think it will, what it will do. Come on, think about it. Okay, so let me just enter it and let's see what happens. So when I say enter, you got E. Okay, so the answer is, when you say minus number, it will start from right to left. Okay, so it will, it will start with the ending. So we just E in this case. That means if I say minus two, it will give you the second last data, which is B, that's right. And if I say minus seven, which will be the first one, right, which is Y, or it works, it goes in reverse order now. Now what if I want to print two characters, not one two. So let's say I want to print Y and O. So in this case, I will say name and I will start with zero. Of course, we want to print zero, the first character and the second character, right? That means we have to give two. Now this two doesn't mean number of characters. It means the ending. So I want to start with zero and one. So first two characters and you can say we got Y zero. The same thing if I do it for one colon four. So come on, guess. So one means second character, right? So it will start with O and it will end at three because you cannot include four. So it will, it is exclusive of four. So it is one, which is O, U and T. Oh, it works. We got out. Yes. Yes, it works. Now what if I specify only one and colon, if I don't specify the ending, what happens? In this case, it will start with one and it will come, it will go till the end. Okay, that house works. If you don't specify the ending part, it will go in that way. What if I specify the ending part, but not the starting point? Example, if I say, or if I keep it blank and after colon, I will say four. Now in this case, it will start with the first letter and it will end at three, which is before four. And that's why you got Y or U, T. So this one, right? Okay, what else we can do here? What if I specify name and I will give it on values. I will say three colon, ten, of course, we don't have ten characters, right? Now in this case, it will end at the last one, which is available. So it will not give you any other in this case. You can see we got T, U, B, E, two. Start with T and then it's end at E because we don't have any other characters. So if you don't, if you want to avoid errors, this is what is one way. Okay. Now I change the letter. Example, I don't want it to be YouTube. I want to, I want it to be my tube. So I will say name from zero to three. I want to change this with my, can I do that? So I'm changing Y or U to my, the moment I say enter, you got an error. It says string object does not support item assignment. So the thing is once you assign the value, you cannot change it. Not even for one character. If I say zero, I want to change the first character to raw tube, even this will not work. You can see we got the error. So you cannot change the value. That means strings in Python is immutable. You cannot change the value of it. That's awesome. Right? But then that doesn't mean you cannot, you cannot change while printing. Example, if I want to print my tube, you can do that. So first I will print my and then I will give a, I will give a space and then plus. I want to print tube, right? So in that case, I will say three colon six. Or maybe the ending part, the matter is you can see we got my tube. If you don't want space, you can do that. You can say my and then without space, you can type it to. So this works. Yeah. So this is how you work with string, you work with variables, right? You can have a number of variables. You can have a float variables and you can have a string variable as well. In fact, with string, we have one more thing. Let's say if you define a string, which is, let's say, my name is a variable and my name here is Navin ready. And if I want to know the length of my name, we can do that. So we have a length function and we can pass my name. As I, as I mentioned, there are some inbuilt functions available in Python. And one of them is length, length. So you can see we got 11 characters. So yeah, that's it from this video where we have talked about different variables, assignments and stuff. So I hope you are enjoying my session. Let me know in the comments section and do you like it? If you're enjoying it, thank you so much for watching everyone. Bye.
